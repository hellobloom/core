/**
 * @notice TokenEscrowMarketplace is an ERC20 payment channel that enables users to send BLT by exchanging signatures off-chain
 *  Users approve the contract address to transfer BLT on their behalf using the standard ERC20.approve function
 *  After approval, either the user or the contract admin initiates the transfer of BLT into the contract
 *  Once in the contract, users can send payments via a signed message to another user. 
 *  The signature transfers BLT from lockup to the recipient's balance
 *  Users can withdraw funds at any time. Or the admin can release them on the user's behalf
 *  
 *  BLT is stored in the contract by accountId. The accountIds are managed by Bloom's AccountRegistry contract
 *  
 *  Only the AttestationLogic contract is authorized to release funds once a jobs is complete
